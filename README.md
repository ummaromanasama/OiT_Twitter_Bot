# OiT_Twitter_Bot_2020

Overview: In Summer 2020, I had the opportunity to intern with Out in Tech as their Programs and Communications Intern. My primary objective was to brainstorm and execute strategies to grow the Out in Tech community. The OiT_Twitter_Bot_2020 is a Twitter bot that favorites tweets involving #outintech and @outintech. Ideally, this would be implemented in the Out in Tech Twitter account and deployed onto Heroku. Tweets related to Out in Tech would be supported and additonal exposure would be curated through the ripple effect on the Twitter's platform.
